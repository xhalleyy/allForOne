All for One

Description: Put all the endpoints are put in one project and deployed. Fetched Apis for each in different scripts. Once the submit button is clicked, the Api is called and the output is changed.

The site is very clean I love the background. One suggestion I would add is changing the input fields type to "number" rather than "text" that way the user can't type in letters regardless and it will only take numbers. Other than that everything works as it should with no issues.
